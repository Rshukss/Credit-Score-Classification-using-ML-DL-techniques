Model,Accuracy,F1-Score (Class 0),Precision (Class 0),Recall (Class 0),F1-Score (Class 1),Precision (Class 1),Recall (Class 1),Remarks
Logistic Regression,0.8356,0.90,0.85,0.97,0.43,0.70,0.31,Relatively low precision and recall for defaulters (Class 1). May not be the best choice if accurately identifying defaulters is crucial.
Decision Tree,0.8700,0.92,0.90,0.94,0.65,0.70,0.60,Shows potential for identifying defaulters but room for improvement.
Random Forest,0.9027,0.94,0.92,0.97,0.73,0.83,0.64,Performs well in identifying defaulters with a good balance between precision and recall.
MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron),0.8708,0.92,0.89,0.95,0.63,0.74,0.55,Alternative to Decision Tree, capable of handling non-linear relationships between features.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network),0.8716,0.92,0.88,0.97,0.60,0.80,0.47,Shows potential for credit score classification, especially in capturing spatial patterns or dependencies among features.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network),0.8347,0.91,0.83,0.99,0.34,0.84,0.21,May not be the best choice for identifying defaulters, struggles with recall.
Hybrid (CNN + RNN),0.8431,0.91,0.86,0.96,0.49,0.70,0.38,Combines strengths of CNN and RNN, but does not show significant improvement over other models.
